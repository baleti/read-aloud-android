 * each sentence's own estimated word timings (not AudioTrack's hardware
 * frame position - simpler to get right, and the timings are already
 * estimates, so a little wall-clock drift doesn't cost real accuracy).
 *
 * All synthesized sentences for the current session stay in memory
 * (allSentences) instead of being discarded once played, so seeking can
 * actually replay real PCM rather than fake a scrub bar. Seeking past the
 * end of what's been synthesized so far just clamps to it - this is a
 * live stream, not a finished file, so there's genuinely nothing there
 * yet; the reported duration grows as more of it arrives.
 *
 * Deliberately source-agnostic: callers enqueue whatever sentence audio
 * they have, whether that's from /tts/stream (reading the digest or an
 * article) or /agent/chat (reading a streamed agent reply aloud sentence
 * by sentence as it arrives) - this service has no idea which, and doesn't
